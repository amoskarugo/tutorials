A Stream is a sequence of elements that supports functional-style operations. Unlike Collections, 
a Stream does not store data it only processes it.

1. Features of Streams

    Declarative: Write concise and readable code using functional style.
    Lazy Evaluation: Operations are executed only when needed (terminal operation).
    Parallel Execution: Supports parallel streams to leverage multi-core processors.
    Reusable Operations: Supports chaining of operations like map(), filter(), sorted().
    No Storage: Streams don’t store data; they only process it.

How does Stream Work Internally?

    Create a Stream: From collections, arrays or static methods.
    Apply Intermediate Operations: Transform data (e.g., filter(), map(), sorted()).
    Apply Terminal Operation: Produce a result (e.g., forEach(), collect(), reduce()).

2. Creation of Streams

Streams Creation can be done by multiple ways:

    From a Collection: Create a stream directly from a List, Set or any Collection using stream()
    From an Array: Use Arrays.stream(array) to convert an array into a stream.
    Using Stream.of(): Create a stream from a fixed set of values using Stream.of().
    Infinite Stream: Generate an unbounded sequence using Stream.iterate() or Stream.generate()

3. Stream Pipeline

A Stream Pipeline defines how data flows through different stages. It has three parts:

3.1 Source

The source provides the data for the stream. It can be a collection, array, file or even an infinite generator.

Example:

    List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30, 40);

    Stream<Integer> stream = numbers.stream(); // Source

3.2 Intermediate Operations

Intermediate operations transform a stream into another stream. Some common intermediate operations include:

    filter(): Filters elements based on a specified condition.
    map(): Transforms each element in a stream to another value.
    Sorted(): Sorts the elements of a stream.
    Distinct(): Remove duplicates.
    Skip(): Skip first n elements.

3.3 Terminal Operations

Terminal Operations are the operations that on execution return a final result as an absolute value.

    ForEach(): It iterates all the elements in a stream.
    collect(Collectors.toList()): It collects stream elements into a list (or other collections like set/map).
    Reduce(): It reduces stream elements into a single aggregated result.
    count(): It returns the total number of elements in a stream.
    anyMatch() / allMatch() / noneMatch(): They check whether elements match a given condition.
    findFirst() / findAny(): They return the first or any element from a stream.

4. Types of Streams

Streams can be categorized into different types based on their nature and usage.

4.1 Sequential Stream

    Processes elements one by one in a single thread.
    Created by default when you call stream().

4.2 Parallel Streams

Parallel Streams are the type of streams that can perform operations concurrently on multiple threads. These Streams are meant to make use of multiple processors or cores available to speed us the processing speed. There are two methods to create parallel streams are mentioned below:

    Using the parallel() method on a stream
    Using parallelStream() on a Collection

4.3 Infinite Streams

Streams can also generate unbounded sequences. Use limit() to avoid infinite execution.

4.4 Primitive Streams

Java provides specialized streams for primitive data types:

    IntStream -> for int values
    LongStream -> for long values
    DoubleStream -> for double values

6. Stream vs Collection difference

   Collection stores data in memory and represents a data structure (e.g., List, Set, Map).
   Stream does not store data; it processes data from a source (like a collection) in a functional, declarative way.
