Java methods are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and help organize your program.
 They improve code readability, reduce repetition, and make debugging easier.

 Method Call Stack in Java

 Java is an object-oriented and stack-based programming language where methods play a key role in controlling the program's execution flow. When a method is called, Java uses an internal structure known as the call stack to manage execution, variables, and return addresses.
 What is the Call Stack

 The call stack is a data structure used by the program during runtime to manage method calls and local variables. It operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner, meaning the last method called is the first one to complete and exit.
 How Are Methods Executed

 When a method is called:

     A new stack frame is added to the call stack to store method details.
     The method runs its code.
     After execution, the stack frame is removed, and control goes back to the calling method.

 Java automatically manages the call stack using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

 Types of Methods in Java
 1. Predefined Method

 Predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java class libraries.
  It is also known as the standard library method or built-in method.

  2. User-defined Method

  The method written by the user or programmer is known as a user-defined method. These methods are modified according to the requirement.
