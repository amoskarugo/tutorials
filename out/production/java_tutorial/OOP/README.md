Java OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) Concepts

Key Features of OOP in Java:

    Structures code into logical units (classes and objects)
    Keeps related data and methods together (encapsulation)
    Makes code modular, reusable and scalable
    Prevents unauthorized access to data
    Follows the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle

Characteristics of an OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) 

1. Class
   A Class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. 
   It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. 
   Using classes, you can create multiple objects with the same behavior instead of writing their code multiple times
2. Object
   An Object is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities.
3. Abstraction    
in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details and only showing the essential details or features to the user.
4. Encapsulation
   Encapsulation is defined as the process of wrapping data and the methods into a single unit, typically a class.
5. Inheritance - It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. 
   We are achieving inheritance by using extends keyword. Inheritance is also known as "is-a" relationship.
6. Polymorphism
   The word polymorphism means having many forms, and it comes from the Greek words poly (many) and morph (forms),
     this means one entity can take many forms. In Java, polymorphism allows the same method or object to behave differently based on the context,
      specially on the project's actual runtime class.
   Types of Polymorphism
    i. Method Overloading - compile-time polymorphism
    ii. Method Overriding - run-time polymorphism
